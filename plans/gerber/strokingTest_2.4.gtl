G04 Tests the Gerber spec, section 2.4 - Stroking *
G04 Relevant wording from the sections follows: *
G04 "The only apertures allowed stroking are the solid circle and the solid rectangle standard *
G04 apertures (line segments only for the rectangle)." *
G04 *
G04 "Note: The rectangle is not automatically rotated to align with the draw." *
G04 *
G04 Note that no D03 commands are used, instead: *
G04 "Zero-length arcs and draws are allowed. The resulting image is the same as the flashed *
G04  aperture. Hower, the graphics object is a draw or arc, not a flash." *
