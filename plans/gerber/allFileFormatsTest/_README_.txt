Otherplan should allow all Gerber file sets to be imported, regardless of which
PCB CAD program exports them. When a new file set (extensions, etc.) is found, 
place the files in this directory and try to import them into Otherplan.  If 
Otherplan is parsing the filenames and extensions correctly, the new set should
be recognized correctly.  If there are any errors, discrepancies or unexpected
behavior, file a bug.

Cheers,
 The Mgmt.
